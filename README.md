Fluffify for Chrome
==================

Coorporate phrases and 'enterprise' words turn our stomach, let's cut through the coorporate phrases on the Internet and frame sentences in a better way. We've devised a Chrome plugin to do this, it will replace the terms we're so sick and / or bored of hearing - to an equivalent that we're not. 

Go ahead and make a pull request to [add more words](https://github.com/serverdensity/Fluffify/tree/master/fluffify/data) to share with your fellow downloaders. You can also download the plugin at the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fluffify/aiifcleijeipadfhbgmcjapekknfkamg) 


Inspired by the famous extension 'Cloud-to-butt', [XKCD #1288](http://xkcd.com/1288/) and Clarke's third law; "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".
