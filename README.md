The Magic Fluffify
==================

It is annoying to read all these prententious buzzword all over the internet by marketing people all around. They don't even know what they are doing. So here we are to save the day. 

Inspired by the famous extension 'Cloud-to-butt', [XKCD #1288](http://xkcd.com/1288/) and Clarke's third law; "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".

We have a plugin to turn marketing speek into what it really is, arcane sysadmin magic.  

Go ahead and make a pull request to [add more words](https://github.com/serverdensity/Fluffify) to share with your fellow downloaders. You can also download the plugin here: URL.
